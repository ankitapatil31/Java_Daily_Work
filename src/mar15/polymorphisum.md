-- compile time polymorphism is static polymorphism 
--- Whenever an object is bound with its functionality at the compile time, this is known as the compile-time polymorphism.
--- At compile-time, java knows which method to call by checking the method signatures. So this is called compile-time polymorphism or static or early binding.
--- Method Overloading says you can have more than one function with the same name in one class having a different prototype.

-- runtime polymorphism is dynamic polymorphism 
--- Whenever an object is bound with the functionality at run time, this is known as runtime polymorphism.
--- Java virtual machine determines the proper method to call at the runtime, not at the compile time. It is also called dynamic or late binding.

-- object class is main class form all classes... 

-- up casing happen when we do run time polymorphism  
-- jevha apan object ha child class cha and tyachi najar hi base chi thevto tyala 
upcasting bolto and tyala ch runtime polymorphism bolto..
