we can not create a object of interface 
but we can create object of child class and assign it to interface class object. 

ex: 

extends keyword is used to inherit a class or interface, while implements keyword is used to implement the interfaces.
A class can extend only one class but can implement any number of interfaces.
A subclass that extends a superclass may override some of the methods from superclass. A class must implement all the methods from interfaces.
