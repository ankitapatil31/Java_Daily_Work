1. what is jenkins? and why we used ?
   jenkins is primarily used for automating the software development lifecycle, particularly in the areas of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), to build, test, and deploy applications efficiently and reliably. It achieves this by automating tasks, integrating with various tools, and managing pipelines for consistent releases.
   Here's a more detailed breakdown of why Jenkins is used:
   1. Automation of Software Development:
      Continuous Integration (CI):
      Jenkins automatically builds, tests, and integrates code changes from developers into a shared repository. This allows for early detection of errors and ensures that the code is always in a deployable state.
      Continuous Deployment (CD):
      Jenkins can automate the process of deploying applications to different environments (e.g., testing, staging, production) after successful testing. This allows for faster and more frequent software releases.
      Pipeline-as-Code:
      Jenkins allows users to define and manage CI/CD pipelines as code, making them versionable, repeatable, and easier to collaborate on.
   2. Integration with Various Tools:
      Version Control Systems: Jenkins integrates seamlessly with popular version control systems like Git, SVN, and Bitbucket.
      Build Tools: It supports various build tools like Maven, Gradle, and Ant.
      Testing Frameworks: Jenkins integrates with testing frameworks like JUnit, Selenium, and TestNG.
      Deployment Platforms: It integrates with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
      Other Tools: Jenkins can integrate with other tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and monitoring systems.
   3. Benefits of Using Jenkins:
      1 Reduced Manual Effort:
      Automation eliminates repetitive tasks, reducing the potential for human error and saving time.
      2 Faster Release Cycles:
      Automating the build, test, and deployment processes allows for faster and more frequent software releases.
      3 Improved Code Quality:
      Continuous integration and automated testing help identify and fix issues early in the development process.
