Create a Java program to model different types of vehicles. Define a superclass called
[Vehicle], which has the following attributes and methods: Attributes: [make, model, year]
Methods: [start(), stop(), displayInfo()] Next, create two subclasses Car and Motorcycle
that inherit from the Vehicle class. Each subclass should have an additional attribute 
specific to its type ([numDoors] for Car and [numCylinders] for Motorcycle), along with
any necessary methods. Then, create a subclass [ElectricCar] that inherits from the Car 
class. ElectricCar should have an additional attribute [batteryCapacity] and a method 
[chargeBattery()]. Finally, write a Main class to demonstrate the functionality of these
classes by [creating objects of Car, Motorcycle, and ElectricCar and calling their methods.]
