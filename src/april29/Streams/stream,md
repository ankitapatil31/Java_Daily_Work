stream naver ever modify existing collection.. it create new one.

catergories:
1. intermediatery methods: which retrun stream object
2. Terminatory : not retrun  stream object..

until and unless... intermediatry methods used we can create a pipline for opration.. but one we used terminary methods then dead end..
date procesing much simpler in streams.


// add at least one terminatory method in stream..

// we can used any data set.. not just collection.. any dataset/ data sourse/ file/ etc.. we can used


what is stream?
Ans: we can apply series of oprations which can be pipline.. we can used any data set..


if we have a exsiting data then used : stream.of(1,3,5,6); used this methods
if we want to call rest api or any thired party provide data then used...
    stream.genrate();

parallelstreams();
